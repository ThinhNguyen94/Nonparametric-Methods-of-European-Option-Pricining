# Nonparametric-Methods-of-European-Option-Pricining
The project experiments the behaviour of simulated stock prices, generated using Euler discretization scheme, under geometric Brownian 
motion process and stochastic volatility process, and implements Black-Scholes and Merton (BSM) and Heston models in evaluating the 
European vanilla options. Further, Empirical Esscher Transform (EET) and Empirical Characteristic Function (ECF) methods were also carried 
out to evaluate European vanilla options on those simulated prices and compare with the BSM and Heston models. A test of accuracy for EET
and ECF were carried out using Monte Carlo method with the absolute percentage errors of less than 5% to be accepted.
